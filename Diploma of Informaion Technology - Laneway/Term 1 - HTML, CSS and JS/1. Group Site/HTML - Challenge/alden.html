    <h1>Alden The Sage</h1>
    <p>
      Alden the sage, connoisseur of the infinity of the universe, who with his
      wisdom has managed to win thousands of battles with his warriors, also
      frequented the stays of Nienna and from her he learned piety and patience.
      He was chosen to be part of the group of Maiar sent incognito to
      Middle-earth (known as Istari, "the Wizards") to help in the cause against
      Sauron in the middle of the Third Age of the Sun, when his evil power was
      rising again. He was the wisest of the Istari order, rivaling Saruman,
      originally the leader of the Order.
